# Hexagonal-Architecture-Spring-Boot-Postgres-JPA-JDBC
Project that me, SÃ³nia Ferreira and https://github.com/SF97 did for a course of our Master's in Software Engineering.

Basically we created a hexagonal architecture to accomodate switches between JPA and JDBC.

You can run this project through docker.
